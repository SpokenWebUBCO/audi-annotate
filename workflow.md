### Part 1: Creating Labels in Audacity

1. Open Audacity, and in the top left, navigate to file→ Open → file name

2. On the warning screen, make sure the make a copy choice is selected, then click ok.

3. There are multiple ways to annotate a stanza. First, we’ll try ranges. To insert a range, you’ll pause the poem by clicking the “p” key when you hear the first line of the stanza begin. 

4. Click the time marker line to mark the place in time where you want to add the label. This typically will correspond to the place where you paused the audio (see image below)
